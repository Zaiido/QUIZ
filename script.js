// RULES:
// The player must guess correctly a certain amount of questions
// Each correct answer gives him one point
// Answers could be multiple or true/false
// At the end of the game, the user must know his/her total score

// QUESTIONS:
// You can get them from this URL ( http://bit.ly/strive_QUIZZ ) or you can write your own
// Could be multiple or boolean (true / false)

// HINTS:
// Keep a global variable score for the user score
// Keep a variable questionNumber for the question the user is answering
// When questionNumber is bigger then the available questions, present the score
// Start working with the questions saved in a variable (or you can use AJAX for fetching external questions if you already know how to do it!)
// Start with the easier version and THEN implement the EXTRAs
// Please debug everything / try it on the console to be sure of what to expect from your code

// EXTRA:
// Show if the answer provided was the wrong one or correct it after clicking
// Present the questions one at a time instead of having all of them displayed together
// Let the user select difficulty and number of questions (you can get q/a from https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=18&difficulty=easy modifying amount and difficulty)

/* WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED
  Commit and push the code to your personal GitHub repository; then post the link of your commit on the Homework section of today's Eduflow.
